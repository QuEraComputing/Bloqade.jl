# Lattices

## Create a lattice

With EaRyd, we are going to be simulating the quantum evolution of information stored in neutral atoms. While present-day experimental platforms allow distribution of atoms in arbitrary shapes, most often those come in the shape of an organized lattice structure. This is also the natural setup for quantum simulation of statistical models and quantum matter. To get started with EaRyd, you have to decide on the very architecture you want your quantum processor to have!


Creating a lattice is very simple in EaRyd, e.g we can create a square lattice as following

```@repl quick-start
using EaRyd
generate_sites(SquareLattice(), 3, 3)
```

this generates the atom positions on a ``3\times 3`` square lattice using the [`generate_sites`](@ref) function.

we support the following built-in lattice: [`SquareLattice`](@ref), [`KagomeLattice`](@ref), [`HoneycombLattice`](@ref), and more. Please refer to [Lattices](@ref) for more detailed guide of lattice related operation.

## Lattice types

A crystal lattice is completely determined by a set of Bravais lattice vectors (in unit of ``\mu m``) plus atom locations in a unit cell.
A [Bravais lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravais_lattice) is an infinite array of decrete points generated by a set of discrete translation operations described by
```math
\mathbf{R} = n_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \mathbf{a}_2 + \ldots + n_d \mathbf{a}_d
```
where ``d`` is the dimension of space, ``n_1, \ldots, n_d \in Z`` are integers.
The unit cell of a Bravais lattice is defined by specifing its lattice vectors ``(\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{a}_d)``.
To create a simple lattice, we just place one atom at location `(0.0, 0.0)` in a unit cell. The following code defines a triangular lattice.

```@repl quick-start
triangular = GeneralLattice([(1.0, 0.0), (0.5, 0.5*sqrt(3))], [(0.0, 0.0)])
```

!!! note
    You can see the above visulization in one of the following editors
    * a [VSCode](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode) editor,
    * a [Jupyter](https://github.com/JunoLab/Juno.jl) notebook,
    * or a [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook,
    
    But not in a Julia REPL that does not have a graphical display.
    

For composite lattices, one should provide multiple atoms as the second argument to specify atom locations in a unitcell. For example, the honeycomb lattice can be defined by typing
```@repl quick-start
honeycomb = GeneralLattice([(1.0, 0.0), (0.5, 0.5*sqrt(3))],
    [(0.0, 0.0), (0.5, 0.5/sqrt(3))])
```

We provide a few shorthands for several useful lattices.
One can use [`lattice_vectors`](@ref) and [`lattice_sites`](@ref) to access the lattice vectors and atom locations in a unit cell as described in the above section.

##### [`ChainLattice`](@ref)
```@example quick-start
using EaRyd

chain = ChainLattice()
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_vectors(chain)
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_sites(chain)
```

##### [`SquareLattice`](@ref)
```@example quick-start
square = SquareLattice()
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_vectors(square)
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_sites(square)
```

```@example quick-start
generate_sites(square, 5, 5)
```

##### [`RectangularLattice`](@ref)
```@example quick-start
rectangle = RectangularLattice(0.5)
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_vectors(rectangle)
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_sites(rectangle)
```

```@example quick-start
generate_sites(rectangle, 5, 5)
```

##### [`HoneycombLattice`](@ref)
```@example quick-start
honeycomb = HoneycombLattice()
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_vectors(honeycomb)
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_sites(honeycomb)
```

##### [`TriangularLattice`](@ref)
```@example quick-start
triangular = TriangularLattice()
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_vectors(triangular)
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_sites(triangular)
```

##### [`LiebLattice`](@ref)
```@example quick-start
lieb = LiebLattice()
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_vectors(lieb)
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_sites(lieb)
```

##### [`KagomeLattice`](@ref)
```@example quick-start
kagome = KagomeLattice()
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_vectors(kagome)
```

```@example quick-start
lattice_sites(kagome)
```

## Generate and sort sites
One can generate atom locations using the [`generate_sites`](@ref) API.
It will return a [`AtomList`](@ref) instance.

```@example quick-start
atoms = generate_sites(HoneycombLattice(), 3, 5; scale=4.5)
```
where `scale` defines the unit distance (in ``\mu m``) of the lattice.
One can apply predefined filters, e.g. [`rescale_axes`](@ref), [`clip_axes`](@ref), [`offset_axes`](@ref), to manipulate atom locations.

```@example quick-start
rescale_axes(atoms, 0.8)
```

```@example quick-start
clip_axes(atoms, (0.0, 5.0), (0.0, 6.0))
```

```@example quick-start
offset_axes(atoms, 5.0, 5.0)
```

To sort the atoms by the their x-coordinates, one can convert these locations to a [`MaskedGrid`](@ref) representation of the atoms.
```@example quick-start
atoms_in_grid = make_grid(atoms)
```

Then one can get the sorted atoms by typing
```@example quick-start
sorted_atoms = collect_atoms(atoms_in_grid)
```


## User-determined arbitrary lattices

One can also generate atoms located by arbitray positions by directly inputing the atoms' coordinates  
```@repl quick-start
atom_coordinate = [(0.0, 0.0), (0, 5), (0, 8), (5, 2), (6, 7), (9, 6)]
'''


## Query neighbors

One can use [`make_kdtree`](@ref) to generate a [k-d tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) data type for efficient querying neighborhoods in low dimensional space.
```@example quick-start
tree = make_kdtree(sorted_atoms)
```

The return value is a `KDTree` instance, which is defined in package [`NearestNeigbors`](https://github.com/KristofferC/NearestNeighbors.jl). One can use it to query the neighbors of an atom, e.g. one can find the 20 nearest neighbors of the 5-th site by typing
```@example quick-start
neighbors = grouped_nearest(tree, 5, 20)
```

The return value is a [`DistanceGroup`](@ref) instance, and the indices of second nearest neighbors are
```@example quick-start
neighbors[2]
```

One can select and display these atoms with correct labeling by typing
```@example quick-start
img_atoms(sorted_atoms[neighbors[2]]; texts=string.(neighbors[2]))
```

It show the correct second nearest neigbors of site 5.
One can check the docstring of [`img_atoms`](@ref) to know more about how to custom lattice visualization.
