# Registers

Bloqade follows the register interface in [Yao](https://yaoquantum.org). It uses register to 
represent a device and its internal quantum state.
As for our Rydberg emulator, the most commonly used register types are `ArrayReg`
and `SubspaceArrayReg`. They both use a dense array to store
the corresponding quantum state. The only difference is that `SubspaceArrayReg` also stores
a subspace object.

## Basic Interfaces


To create a register with its internal state to be Rydberg ground state ``| 00..00 \rangle``, we can simply use 
the function [`zero_state`](@ref) by specifying the number of qubits

```@repl registers
using Bloqade
zero_state(5) # creates a 5-qubit register
```

To create a more general polarized product state, you can use the [`product_state`](@ref) function by inputing its bit-string

```@repl registers
product_state(bit"10011")
```
where `bit"10011` is a special Julia string literal defined for bitstrings.



## Operations

You can perform various operations on registers via standard [Yao](https://yaoquantum.org)
register interface. This includes applying operators on quantum states by using `apply!`, measuring certain observables on quantum states by using `measure!`, and
calculating the expectation value of certain observables by using `expect`.
