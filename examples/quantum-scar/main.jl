# # Background

# The experimental study [H. Bernien, et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24622) finds that if one starts with a 
# with a particular initial state (e.g. the Neel state), the Rydberg blockade constraint results into persistent revivals of quantum dynamics.
# Later, theoretical studies (e.g. [C. J. Turner, et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-018-0137-5)) reveal that this behavior is due to very 
# specific eigenstates embeded in the quantum many-body spectuum, called quantum many-body scars. 

# Quantum many-body scars are in anology with clasical scars in single-particle quantum chaos, where scars represent a concentration of some eigenfunctions 
# along the trajectory of classical periodic orbits. Similarly, in the quantum many-body case, the initial Neel state has a large component of these specific scar states. 
# Under the time evolution of the Rydberg Hamiltonian, the initial state undergoes the trajectory of periodic quantum orbits. The non-thermal behavior is mainly caused by such non-ergodicity 
# in Hilbert space. 

# In this example, we use the Rydberg Emulator to simulate the evolution of a fully coherent, 
# strongly interacting Rydberg system.  We demonstrate the persistent revivals of many-body dynamics with measurements of the Rydberg density, 
# and entanglement entropy. For a comprehensive review of quantum many-body scars, we refer readers to this paper [M. Serbyn et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01230-2)

# # Rabi oscillations with Rydberg blockade

# We first demonstrate that the strong Rydberg interactions have important effects on the Rabi oscillations of Rydberg atoms. 
# To do so, we consider a system with 1, 2 and 3 atoms. All the atoms are placed withint the blockade radius of any other atom (see [blockade](@ref) for more details). 

atom1 = generate_sites(ChainLattice(), 1, scale=3.0)
atom2 = generate_sites(ChainLattice(), 2, scale= 3.0)
atom3 = generate_sites(ChainLattice(), 3, scale= 3.0)

# Then we a resonant Rabi driving is applied to each of the system. The Hamiltonians can be simply constructed by 
h1 = rydberg_h(atom1; Δ=0, Ω=2π*2)
h2 = rydberg_h(atom2; Δ=0, Ω=2π*2)
h3 = rydberg_h(atom3; Δ=0, Ω=2π*2)

# The initial states are chosen such that all atoms start from the ground state
reg1 = zero_state(1)
reg2 = zero_state(2)
reg3 = zero_state(3)

# We first emulate the dynamics for the single atom's case, where the intial state is quenched under a Hamiltonain with constant Rabi frequency

    end
end

# The Rydberg density of this atom exihibits Rabi oscillations as a function of time, shown by the plot 

lines(ts.*iteration, density_mat1[1, :])

# For the case of 2 and 3 atoms, if they are seperated far enough with negligible interactions, the total Rydberg excitation densities are simply the sum of each each atom. 
# However, we will show that this is not the case for systems when atoms are close to each other (which results in strong Rydberg interactions). 
# Similar to the 1 atom case, we can emulate the dynamics and get the time-dependent dynamics for each atom

# The total Rydberg density for 2 system is plotted below

# The total Rydberg density for 3 system is plotted below

density3 = sum(density_mat3, dims=1)
lines(ts.*iteration, density3[1, :])

# From the above plot, we can see that the total Rydberg density for 2 (3) atom case does not exceed 1. This is because
# it is energitically unfavorable to have more than 1 excitation due to the strong Rydberg interactions. Furthermore, the frequency of Rabi oscillation
# for the whole system depends strongly on the number of atoms. This again validate the fact that intearcion effect plays an important role in the system's dynamics. 


# Below, we show that for a system with 9 atoms where only nearest atoms are within each other's blockade radius, the system can also exhibit nontrivial dynamics for certain initial state.  


# # Build 9-sites Hamiltonian

# We build a 1D-Chain with 9-atom arrangement, with each atom separated from its neighbor by 5.72 ``\mu m``. This results in a nearest-neighbor 
# interaction strength of ``2 \pi * 24`` MHz. This is much larger than the Rabi oscillations ``\Omega``, which we specify below. So the nerest-neighbor
# Rydberg atoms are within the blockade radius, such that both of the atoms can not be excited simultaneously.

Ω1= piecewise_linear(clocks=[0.0, 0.05, 1.6, 2.2], values=[0.0, 4*2π, 4*2π, 0])

# The second part of the waveform has constant value of parameters, so we can use [`constant`](@ref) to construct
Ω2 = constant(duration=2.0, value=2* 2π)
Δ2 = constant(duration=2.0, value=0)

# The waveform for the whole evolution is composed by append the second part to the first part

Ω_tot = append(Ω1, Ω2)
Δ_tot = append(Δ1, Δ2)

# Note that the total evolution is 4.2 ``\mu s``.
# We then build the Hamiltonian by importing the defined lattice structure and waveforms 

h = rydberg_h(atoms; Δ=Δ_tot, Ω=Ω_tot)


# # Emulate the problem

# We evaluate the quench dynamics of the Rydberg atom array initially prepared in ground. 
# Such an initial state can be created by

reg = zero_state(9)

# We can now set up discrete time evolution problem using the ODE solver.
