# # Background

# This example is based on part of the experimental study: [H. Bernien, et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24622). This paper 
# finds that if one starts with particular initial states (e.g. the Neel state), the Rydberg blockade constraint results into persistent revivals of quantum dynamics.
# Later theoretical studies (e.g. [C. J. Turner, et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-018-0137-5)) reveal that this behavior is due to very 
# specific eigenstates embeded in the quantum many-body spectuum, called quantum many-body scars. 

# Quantum many-body scars are in anology with clasical scars in single-particle quantum chaos, where scars represent a concentration of some eigenfunctions 
# along the trajectory of classical periodic orbits. Similarly, in the quantum many-body case, the initial Neel state has a large component of these specific scar states. 
# Under the time evolution of the Rydberg Hamiltonian, the initial state undergoes the trajectory of periodic quantum orbits. The non-thermal behavior is mainly caused by such non-ergodicity 
# in Hilbert space. 

# In this example, we use the Rydberg Emulator to simulate the evolution of a fully coherent, 
# strongly interacting Rydberg system of 9 qubits.  We demonstrate the persistent revivals of many-body dynamics with measurements of the Rydberg density, 
# and entanglement entropy. For a comprehensive review of quantum many-body scars, we refer readers to this very nice paper [M. Serbyn et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01230-2)


# We start by importing required libraries

# # Build Haimltonian

# We build a 1D-Chain with 9-atom arrangement, with each atom separated from its neighbor by 5.72 ``\mu m``. This results in a nearest-neighbor 
# interaction strength of ``2 \pi * 24`` MHz. This is much larger than the Rabi oscillations ``\Omega = 4\pi `` we will specify below. So the nerest-neighbor
# Rydberg atoms are within the blockade radius, such that both of the atoms can not be excited simultaneously. 

nsites = 9;
atoms = generate_sites(ChainLattice(), nsites, scale=5.72)

# We then build the Hamiltonian by importing the defined lattice structure and parameters 

h = rydberg_h(atoms;C = 2π * 858386, Ω=4π)


# # Emulate the problem

# We evaluate the quench dynamics of the Rydberg atom array initially prepared in a Neel product state. Such an initial state can be created by

init = product_state(bit"101010101")

# We can now set up discrete time evolution problem with timestep ts = 0.01 for 120 iterations using Krylov solver
iteration = 1:120
ts = [0.01 for _ in iteration];
hs = [h for _ in iteration];
clocks = cumsum(ts);
prob = KrylovEvolution(init, ts, hs)

# Then we measure the real-time expectation value of Rydberg density, domain wall density, and entanglement entropy. 
# These data are stored in the matrix or vector below. 

density_mat = zeros(nsites, length(iteration)) 
domain_mat = zeros(nsites-1, length(iteration)) 
entropy_vec = zeros(length(iteration)) 

for info in prob
    for i in 1:nsites
        density_mat[i, info.step] = expect(put(nsites, i=>Op.n), info.reg)
    end

    for i in 1:nsites-1
        corr = real(expect(put(nsites, (i, i+1)=>kron(Op.n, Op.n)), info.reg))
        obs = density_mat[i, info.step] + density_mat[i+1, info.step] - 2corr
        domain_mat[i, info.step] = obs
    end

    rho = density_matrix(info.reg, (1,2,3,4,5))
    entropy_vec[info.step] = von_neumann_entropy(rho)
end

# # Plot the results 
# Now we first plot the Rydberg density for each site as a function of time

fig = Figure(size=(5, 3));
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1])

for i in 1:nsites
    lines!(clocks, density_mat[i, :])
end

# To better illustrate the revivals, we plot the results in the colormap 

heatmap(clocks, 1:nsites, density_mat')

# We can see that there is a clear oscillations between the two partterns of the Rydberg density.

# Finally we plot the  average domain wall number and entanglement entropy as a function of time 

fig = Figure(size=(5, 3));

domain_avg = ones(length(iteration))-vec(sum(domain_mat, dims=1)/(nsites-1))

# # A different initial state 

# In order to show that the revivals depends strongly on the initial state, 
# we now choose a different initial state 

init1 = product_state(bit"100000101")
prob1 = KrylovEvolution(init1, ts, hs)
density_mat1 = zeros(nsites, length(iteration)) 

for info in prob1
    for i in 1:nsites

end

heatmap(clocks, 1:nsites, density_mat1')

# From the above figure, we see that the density does not show long-lived oscillations.
